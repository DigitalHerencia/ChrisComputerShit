# Recommendations

The following suggestions emerged from the repository audit:

1. ~~**Centralized Prisma Client** – The dashboard page uses `prisma` without an import. Create a `lib/db.ts` that exports a singleton Prisma client and import it where needed.~~ Implemented via `lib/db.ts` and updated imports across the app.
2. **Feature Modules** – Move business logic and data fetching out of React components into dedicated modules under `features/{domain}` to keep UI components pure.
3. **Error Handling & Loading States** – Implement proper error boundaries and loading indicators for async operations.
4. **Testing Strategy** – Introduce unit and integration tests and define an `npm test` script. Consider using Jest or Vitest.
5. **CI/CD Pipeline** – Add GitHub Actions to run linting, tests, and build on pull requests.
6. **Environment Documentation** – Provide an `.env.example` file with all required variables and add documentation for configuring external services.
7. **Accessibility Audits** – Ensure components meet accessibility standards (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation).
8. **Code Ownership** – Define code owners for critical directories to streamline reviews.
9. **Consistent Styling** – Audit existing components for adherence to the design system (e.g., `rounded-md`, `bg-black`, `p-6`).
10. **Branch Protection Rules** – Configure branch protections on `main` to require successful checks and reviews before merging.
